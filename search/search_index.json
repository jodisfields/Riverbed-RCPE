Useful add-on: SDR is protocol agnostic, so the warm transfer of a byte stream in one application will be equally optimized should that byte stream occur in a different applications. As an example, downloading a file from the datacenter via a file share, then sending the file via email; your local and datacenter SteelHeads will see the file 'cold' when downloading, then 'warm' when that same file is attached to an email. Finally, you verified various optimization statistics in different Reports. Good to note that bandwidth reduction/optimization is enabled by default for all TCP ports not explicitly passed through. Once your SteelHead appliance is plugged in and configured with the initial network settings, you can begin optimizing traffic and notice significant performance increase, with accompanying WAN data reduction.","title":"Knowledge check"},{"location":"first-lab/#knowledge-check","text":"Hint: hovering icons in your Current Connections screen can answer both Parts.

You are now tasked by management to create and share dashboards that display the website\u2019s usage and performance. The new dashboards are to be shared with two user groups, management and the help desk staff on the tier 1 support team. #### Solution Lab Objectives Review the Advanced Web Applications and Host Groups That Have Been Defined on AppResponse to Monitor the Public Website Create an SLA Dashboard in SteelCentral Portal to Monitor the Website\u2019s Most Important Pages and User Locations to be Shared with Management Create a Web Application Performance Dashboard That Monitors the Public Website and That Can be Used by the Helpdesk as Starting Point to Perform Triage and Troubleshooting in the Event of Poor Performance #### Challenge Objectives 1. {Challenge Title} 2. {Challenge Title} Task 1. Review the Advanced Web Applications and Host Groups that have been defined on AppResponse to monitor the public website. Objective In this task, you will browse the data source, AppResponse to observe how it is currently configured to monitor the public website. Detailed Steps Access the AppResponse user interface at https://10.99.31.240 or using the browser bookmark DataCenter Hosts > n31-arx SC AppResponse . If necessary, add the security exception to accept the use of the self-signed certificate. Login using the credentials admin/admin . It may take a few minutes for the Time to synchronize. Navigate to DEFINITIONS > Applications to observe the list of applications currently defined on the AppResponse appliance. Click on the Web tab to view the application definitions used by the AppResponse Web Transaction Analysis Module. Use the information on this page to answer the following questions: How many Web Application definitions are supported on this appliance? How many Web Application definitions have already been defined? What is the Traffic Matching Mode of all of these application definitions? How many of these application definitions are related to the PUBLIC WEBSITE? Click on the Edit button (the Pencil to the right)in the row for the PUBLIC WEBSITE definition (the one with no additional \"Description\") to view the URL and any additional parameters used to define this app. Compare this definition to the definitions used for other PUBLIC WEBSITE pages. Use the information from these definitions to answer the following questions: How long would a page load have to take to complete to be considered a slow page by these definitions? Do the application definitions contain overlapping URL patterns? Which of the application definitions is the most specific? Close the Edit Web Application dialog box. Navigate to DEFINITIONS > Host Groups to observe the list of host groups currently defined on the AppResponse appliance. Sort the Host Group Configuration table by Status by clicking on the descending arrow in the appropriate column header. Use this Host Group table to answer the following questions: How many Host Groups are enabled? How many Host Groups represent office locations? Are there any Host Groups that are enabled but not an office location? You may have to wait 5 minutes for the Host Groups and New Applications to accumulate data. Go to Home Click on recent 1 Hour in the upper right corner. Navigate to INSIGHTS > Web > Web App . Enter PUBLIC WEBSITE as your input. Click Launch to open the Insight. Use the information displayed in the Insight to answer the following questions: How many times was the page viewed in the last hour? What is the average page time for the PUBLIC WEBSITE? Which Web User Group experienced the worst page time? When did the worst page time occur? What page family delivered the worst page time? #### Review Task 2. Create an SLA Dashboard in SteelCentral Portal to monitor the website\u2019s most important pages and user locations to be shared with management. Objective In this task, you will add the AppResponse appliance as a data source for Portal and create dashboards based on packet inspection metrics for the public website. Detailed Steps Access the Portal user interface at https://10.99.31.200 or using the browser bookmark DataCenter Hosts > n31-prtl SC Portal . If necessary, add the security exception to accept the use of the self-signed certificate. Login using the credentials admin/admin . After logging in, you will be prompted to add a data source to Portal. Select Yes to continue and complete the process of adding the data source with the information listed below: Data source type: AppResponse Hostname: 10.99.31.240 Port: 443 Description: eLab AppResponse Username: admin Password: admin Click Connect to proceed. The process will take 1-2 minutes to complete and the final result should be Connected Successfully . Navigate to DASHBOARDS > Create . In the resulting Create a New Dashboard wizard, scroll down select the SLA Dashboard by Page Time (AppResponse) and click Next to continue. On the Select Web User Groups step, select all of the Office locations and Default- Internet Group and click Next to continue. On the Select Web Applications step, select all of the PUBLIC WEBSITE applications and click Next to continue. On the Select Data Sources step, select Use all connected data sources and click Next to continue. On the Set dashboard options step, change the Dashboard Name to Public Website SLA Dashboard , leave the Dashboard Size as current browser size and click Create . Congratulations, you have now created your first Portal dashboard. This is a high level SLA Dashboard that is suitable for management and line-of-business owners to monitor the status of application performance from each location without configuring or navigating the underlying AppResponse data source. Ideally each LED on this dashboard would show a page time within acceptable limits represented by the green check-mark. Explore the Drilldown options available from the LEDs on the SLA Dashboard. On a single LED that is in the critical state (red X), right-click > Drilldowns > Web Application Details . Use the resulting Dashboard to answer the following questions: Which Web User Group experienced the worst page time? For this group, which component of delay was the highest contributor to page time? Hint: Hover over bar chart components for numerical values. Return to your SLA dashboard by navigating to DASHBOARDS > RECENTS > Public Website SLA . Find and use the drilldown option that allows you to view the performance of all web applications for a specific site, Great Lakes Office . What is the web app with the highest throughput at this site? What is the web app with the highest number of slow pages at this site? How many Slow Pages for the public website were experienced at this site? #### Review Task 3. Create a web application performance dashboard that monitors the public website and that can be used by the helpdesk as a starting point to perform triage and troubleshooting in the event of poor performance. Objective In this task, you will design your dashboards to meet the needs of two specific groups in your enterprise, IT management and the help- desk. Detailed Steps Navigate to DASHBOARDS > Create . In the resulting Create New Dashboard wizard, scroll down select the Web Application Details dashboard template and click Next to continue. On the Select a Web Application Step, start by typing PUBLIC WEBSITE in the search box and select PUBLIC WEBSITE from the drop down menu when available. On the Select Data Sources step, select Use all connected data sources and click Finish to continue. Click Create to complete the dashboard. Use the dashboard to answer the following questions: Which Page Family delivered the worst page time? Were there any 5xx Server errors observed for this web app? What were the server IP addresses observed for this app? Drilldown into Page Views to identify the busiest servers and clients. Find the PUBLIC WEBSITE Usage panel. On Page Views sparkline, right-click > Drilldowns > Top Server IPs . Repeat the steps above to identify the Top Client IPs. Use the resulting pop-up panels to find: What Client IP had the most page views? How many page views were served by the Top Server? Close the pop-up panels. Drilldown into the slowest Page Family to create a Page Family Details dashboard. On the slowest page family, right-click > Drilldowns > Page Family Details . Use the new dashboard to identify: The slowest client. The slowest server. The slowest user group. #### Review Challenge Objective In this challenge, you will find the problematic web page objects on the single slowest public website page view from the Great Lakes office starting in Portal and filtering down to AppResponse individual page views. Hints Return to your Public Website: Web Application Details dashboard. Launch into Summary: Page Views from the Great Lakes Office Web User Group . Use the resulting AppResponse Insight to answer the following questions: How would you describe what the True Plot panel shows? How many unique users accessed the website from this location? What was the page time of the slowest page? What was the slowest object on the page? Was the object slow due to request, response or server time? #### Review ### Challenge 2 #### Objective In this challenge, you will create an SLA dashboard for monitoring MS Office application performance by location in SteelCentral Portal using only Aternity Activity Scores. #### Hints 1. Navigate to **Administration > Data Sources > Add**. 2. Add the LMS SaaS instance of Aternity as a data source for Portal using the following: Hostname: lms-datasource.aternity.com Port: 443 Username: SCAternityPortal_2 Password: 2_163a23b94c8_HlxteFyM72tsiYjJMhbHnNqjP6m6ek 3. Use the Create Dashboard wizard to find and use the appropriate template for an Aternity SLA dashboard. 4. Follow the steps in the wizard to create a dashboard for all Office Locations and all MS Office apps. ![screenshot](https://edu-screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/current/98fa87d7-df98-45f4-9eef-7f79da555b03.png \"Screenshot\") 5. Use the resulting dashboard to answer the following: - What drilldown options are available from this SLA dashboard? - What is the only option to navigate from this Portal dashboard to an Aternity Dashboard? #### Review End of Scenario This lab exercise demonstrated the use of two different types of dashboards in SteelCentral Portal. The type of dashboard you choose to create depends on the definitions and metrics available from your data sources and the specific requirements of the consumers of dashboard. You first reviewed the existing configuration of app definitions and host groups on the AppResponse appliance before adding it as a data source to Portal. Next, you created two new dashboards and explored a few of the available drilldown options for creating additional dashboards and pop-up panels on demand. </div> </div>","title":"Lab 2aa"},{"location":"license-tiers/","text":"License Tiers","title":"License Tiers"},{"location":"license-tiers/#license-tiers","text":"","title":"License Tiers"},{"location":"mgmt-and-config/","text":"Management and Configuration Management is available on all interfaces by default Rest API for special purposes such as automation Graphical User Interface via HTTP / HTTPS MIB downloadable from the GUI Telnet (disabled by default) Rest API SNMP SSH BMC Best Practice: Always use the SCC.
