# Quick Notes

## SteelHead-V Best Practices

- **Dont's** ‚ùå
  - Do not share NICS and use at least 1Gbps
  - Do not use hyperthreading
  - Do not share physical disks between hosts
  - Do not over provision CPU Use a Server Grade CPU for the Hypervisor
<br>
- **Do's:** ‚úÖ
  - Allow resources Hypervisor overhead
  - Always reserve Virtual RAM / Physical RAM
  - Use SSDs or other high speed disk for the Segstore
  - Apply BIOS power settings for maximum performance

## Steel Head-v and Riverbed Bypass NIC

Riverbed Bypass NIC-A physical card for the virtual device.

- **ESX/ESXI**
  - Direct Path feature
  - Allows SteelHead-v to contral the bypass hardware:
  - ESXI driver available from the support website Under related Software
- **Hyper-V & KVM support**

## Deployment Methods: Physical In-Path

- LAN & WAN Connected
- We will look into more detail on:
  - Serial clusters Parallel clusters
  - Simplified Routing
  - Failover Scenarios

## Deployment Methods: Virtual In-Path

- WAN physically connected - in-paths interfaces used for optimization
- We will look into more detail on:
  - Policy-based Routing
  - WCCP
  - Interceptor
  - Layer-4 Switch

## Deployment Methods - Cloud Optimization Cloud Computing

- **Private cloud:**
  - Resources match demand, but can be slow or expensive to adapt Management of resources without restrictions
  - Security Compliance
  - High Availability, but at a cost
- **Public cloud:**
  - Scalable and agile
  - Consumer-based billing
  - High Availability
- **Hybrid cloud:**
  - As the name implies.

## Deployment Methods & Network Asymmetry

- Network Asymmetry Affects Optimization
- Asymmetric Routing (AR) can be disruptive in optimized environments!
- SteelHeads need two-way traffic to optimize, regardless of topology:
  - In-path
  - virtual in-path

> Virtual in-path can also be a solution, more later

![asymmetric-routing](images/inpass-diagram.png)

- As a result the initial connection will take longer, or even fail SteelHeads will pass through all IP pairs for 24 hours when AR detected. This is to avoid reoccurring fallures
- The table can be flushed manually, but must be done on all affected SteelHeads
- Consider manual reset or an auto-kickoff rule

> *Remember **nothing** happens until we see a **SYN message**.*

---

## Enhanced Auto Discovery (EAD)

- **Why Use EAD?**

  - Default since RIOS version 5.5.4
  - Used to find the LAST Steel Head, not the first
  - Useful on double WAN hops
    - Also useful in serial deployments, but peering rules are much better
    - Faster to fail when the server is not available
    - Faster to detect network asymmetry

![auto-discovery-flow](images/ead-probe.png)

- **Why Not Use EAD?**

  - May need to be disabled in certain SaaS backhaul deployments, or when overcoming egregious WAN latency such as double satellite

## Wireshark PCAP of EAD traffic

```log

## Transparency Options Field

> Carried in EVERY packet, after SYN and SYN/ACK

- Configured on in-path rules: Can be with Fixed Target (on cli and in-path only)
- Filter on Wireshark: tcp.options.rvbd.trpy
- 4e labels packets as "WAN side Optimized" for use by:
  - SteelHeads
  - Interceptors
  - SteelCentral devices
  - Contains pseudo Src/Dest IP and ports
  - Effectively NAT/PAT on egress of steelhead

![transparency-options](images/transparency-options.png)

---

## Why use different modes?

- Honestly, in most circumstances, correct addressing is fine however it does depend on the Steel Head deployment method.
- In SD-WAN environments, full transparency is required so that the SD-WAN policy in place to use a different bearer based on the application or any 5 tuples.
- Disadvantages of transparency:
  - You lose a feature called Connection pooling, where 20 TCP connections are pre-established between every peer. This skips the need for a 3-way handshake when a session over the WAN is initiated.****

## Management and Configuration (Mgmt & Config)

> Management is available on all interfaces by default

- Rest API for special purposes such as automation
- Graphical User Interface via HTTP / HTTPS
- MIB downloadable from the GUI
- Telnet *(disabled by default)*
- Rest API
- SNMP
- SSH
- BMC

> Best Practice: Always use the SCC.

- **CLI Command Entry Modes**
  - User
  - Enable
  - Config

## Housekeeping - Licensing Structure

- Licenses are small strings of text tied to the HW
  - Example: LK1-SH40SSL-0000-0000-5-8B40-0361-F11D
- Basic Licenses plus options and sizing can be added by:
  - CLI
  - GUI
  - Call Home function

---

## Housekeeping - Export Flow Statistics

- NetFlow and other Flow Data Collectors gather network statistics about network hosts, protocols and ports, peak usage times, traffic paths, and others
- The flow data collectors update flow records with information pertaining to each packet traversing a specified network interface

---

## Housekeeping - Flow Data Component Basics

- Exporter - A device that sees the data flows going through the network, such as a SteelHead or a router
- Collector - A server or appliance designed to aggregate data sent to it by NetFlow Exporter, such as Steel Central Flow Gateway
- Analyzer - A collection of tools (usually provided in conjunction with a collector) used to analyze the data and provide relevant data summaries and graphs, such as SteelCentral NetProfiler

---

## Housekeeping - Configuration Management

- The Configuration is held in binary format
- Pasting a text file to the CLI is NOT recommended
- Configuration files are backed up locally with a .bak copy and can be uploaded manually to a server - Files are also regularly backed up to the SCC
- Files can be saved locally before every change
- Creates an easy rollback if required in a service window

---

## Authentication

The following user authentication methods are available for administrative and monitoring purposes:

üîí Local
üîí SAML
üîí RADIUS
üîí TACACS+

Custom Shell profiles and AV pairs are required for SteelHeads This is covered by many knowledgebase articles.

- Admin Account: Administrator privileges
- Monitor Account: Read only access
- Gist is available for Cisco ACS environments in article 516158
- Typically local site admins don't need RW access as everything **Should be managed via an SCC**.

> If you make changes locally and don't reflect them on the SCC, they'll be wiped next time there is a push.
