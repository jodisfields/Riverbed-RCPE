## Overview

After having deployed a SteelConnect-EX Headend in Azure, following a cookbook like [SteelConnect-EX Standalone Headend in Azure](../Azure-DeployHeadend), you will probably need to deploy some SteelConnect-EX FlexVNF appliances in the VNET of multiple Azure Locations.

This cookbook allows to deploy the SteelConnect-EX FlexVNF image automating the creation of some Azure Image resource in other Azure Locations.

## Prerequisites

This cookbook requires URI with a SAS Token.

You might already have the VHD in one of your storage account (for example if you have used the [Deploy Headend Cookbook](../Azure-DeployHeadend)), here is how to get the URI and generate a SAS Token

| Tasks | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Browse the Storage Account and the Blob Container that contain the .vhd of SteelConnect EX FlexVNF appliance |<ul><li>Resource Group name: **Riverbed-Images**</li><li>Container name: **images**</li></ul> |
| 2. Select the vhd and copy the URL |<ul><li>**URL**: http</li></ul> |
| 3. Generate a temporary Shared Access Signature for this Storage Account/Container. Hit **Generate SAS and connection string** button | <ul><li>Allowed services: Blob</li><li>End date: few days</li></ul>![azure-sa-sas-creation](images/azure-sa-sas-creation.png)|


## Steps

### Deploy using a script

#### 1. Open a PowerShell Console 

A PowerShell console having Az module and azcopy is required, like the Azure Cloud Shell.

Azure Cloud Shell can be launch from the Azure Portal, or connecting to [shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com), or by clicking
[![Embed launch](https://shell.azure.com/images/launchcloudshell.png "Launch Azure Cloud Shell")](https://shell.azure.com)

#### 2. Get Riverbed Community Toolkit sources

The following PowerShell downloads the latest sources from Riverbed Community Toolkit git repository on GitHub.

```PowerShell
# Get a local copy of the Riverbed Community Toolkit scripts from Github
git clone https://github.com/riverbed/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit.git

#  Initialization script
Set-Location ./Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/
Set-Location SteelConnect/Azure-DeployImageInLocations
```

#### 3. Connect Azure context

The PowerShell script below allows to check and set the Azure context.

```PowerShell
# Check the Azure context, i.e check if subscription and tenant id are correct
Get-AzContext

# uncomment the line below if not already connected to Azure.
# Connect-AzAccount

# uncomment the line below and replace {your subscription name} if you need to select a different subscription
# Set-AzContext -SubscriptionName "{your subscription name}"
```

#### 4. Fill parameters and run the script

The script New-ImageFromVhdUri requires the following parameters:

| Parameters | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| DestinationLocations | comma separated list of Azure Location or "ALL" for all Azure Locations | westeurope,francecentral,koreacentral  or  ALL |
| DestinationVhdFileName | filename of the vhd to be copied in each Location. Can be the same name as in the source. | steelconnect-ex-flexvnf-20.2.vhd
| DestinationImageBaseName | will be use to create Azure Image resource. The name will be {ImageBaseName}-{Location} |  steelconnect-ex-20.2 |
| SourceVhdUri | url of the vhd file in the Storage Account | "https://yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/images/steelconnect-ex-flexvnf-20.2-30239j.vhd"
| SourceSASToken | a valid SAS token generated on the Storage Account to grant read access to the vhd Blob | "?sv=2019-10-10&ss=b&srt=co&sp=rwdlacx&se=2020-07-22T05:51:31Z&st=2020-07-21T21:51:31Z&spr=https&sig=JAFoNef" |

For example the following script will deploy the images in the resource group Riverbed-Images

```PowerShell
./New-ImageFromVhdUri.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "Riverbed-Images" -Location "westeurope" `
    -DestinationLocations westeurope,francecentral,koreacentral,westus,southeastasia `
    -DestinationVhdFileName "steelconnect-ex-flexvnf-20.2-bhd93.vhd" `
    -DestinationImageBasename "steelconnect-ex-20.2" `
    -SourceVhdUri "https://yourstorageccount.blob.core.windows.net/images/steelconnect-ex-flexvnf-20.2.vhd" `
    -SourceSASToken "?sv=2019-10-10&ss=b&srt=co&sp=rwdlacx&se=2020-07-22T05:51:31Z&st=2020-07-21T21:51:31Z&spr=https&sig=JAFoNefbVBktBuWIe2sYTNV3bCf1jjx%2FuERl%2FC%2BSsWo%3D"
```

## Usage

The script will usually take few minutes to deploy the image in each location. When done the Storage Account and Image resources will be available in the resource group (default name: Riverbed-Images).

![images in resource group](images/resource-group-steelconnect-ex-images.png)

The Image resource can be be used to deploy the SteelConnect appliances directly from the Azure portal (navigate to the image and hit Create VM), referencing the image in an ARM templates, or else using the automated deployment from the SteelConnect-EX Director.


## Howto

### Delete the temporary Storage Accounts created in each Location?

The following script will list the Storage Account resources created in the resource group (default name: "Riverbed-Images") and having the default Image prefix name ("rctimg").

```PowerShell
Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "Riverbed-Images" | Where-Object { $_.StorageAccountName -like "rctimg*" } | Select-Object StorageAccountName,ResourceGroupName,Location
```

Then all the Storage Account can be deleted with the following command (using the default Resource Group name and Image prefix name.

```PowerShell
Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "Riverbed-Images" | Where-Object { $_.StorageAccountName -like "rctimg*" } | Remove-AzStorageAccount -Force
```
