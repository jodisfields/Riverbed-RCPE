This Terraform Template is intended to Automate the bringing up Riverbed Head End setup on Azure in standalone mode.

# Pre-requisites for using this template:

- **Terraform Install:** To Download & Install Terraform, refer Link "www.terraform.io/downloads.html"
- **Terraform Setup for Azure:** To Setup Terraform for Azure Account, refer link "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/terraform-install-configure".
  Here you will get Subscription ID, Client ID, Client Secret and Tenant ID required for terraform login.
- **Riverbed Head End Images:** Image available and added in Azure in .vhd format for:
  - Riverbed Director
  - Riverbed Controller
  - Riverbed Analytics
  
- **Role:** At least &quot;contributor&quot; level role is required to the Terraform user used to run this template.

# Usage:

- Download all the files in PC where Terraform is installed. It is recommended that place all the files in new/separate folder as terraform will store the state file for this environment once it is applied.
- Go to the folder where all the required files are placed using command prompt.
- Use command `terraform init` to initialize. it will download necessary terraform plugins required to run this template.
- Then use command `terraform plan` to plan the deployment. It will show the plan regarding all the resources being provisioned as part of this template.
- At last use command `terraform apply` to apply this plan in action for deployment. It will start deploying all the resource on Azure.


It will require below files to run it.

- main.tf file.
- var.tf file.
- terraform.tfvars file.
- output.tf file.
- director.sh file.
- controller.sh file.
- van.sh file.

**main.tf file:**

main.tf template file will perform below actions/activities when executed:

- Provision one resource group with name "Riverbed_HE". Resource Group name can be changed if required after updating terraform.tfvars file.
- Provision Virtual Network (10.234.0.0/16). This can be changed after updating terraform.tfvars file.
- Provision 3 Subnets with /24 network. By default, 10.234.1.0/24, 10.234.2.0/24 & 10.234.3.0/24 networks are used. This can be changed after updating terraform.tfvars file.
  - First network (10.234.1.0/24) for management of all the rvbd HE instances. Here Public IP will be assigned to each port.
  - Second network (10.234.2.0/24) for Director SB, Controller NB and Analytics SB ports. This is control network.
  - Third network (10.234.3.0/24) will be for Controller SB and branch connectivity. This is WAN network.
- Provision Public IP for all the instances for Management Port and also one Static Public IP for Controller WAN Port.
- Provision Route (User Defined Route) to use controller address as a gateway for the IPSec overlay network address for the netconf traffic originating from Director.
- Provision Network Security Group and add all the firewall rules required for HE setup.
- Provision Network Interfaces for all the instances.
- Install Riverbed Director instance and run cloud-init script for:
  - Updating the /etc/network/interface file.
  - Updating the /etc/hosts and hostname file.
  - Inject the ssh key for Administrator User
  - Generate the new certificates.
  - Execute vnms-startup script in non-interactive mode.
- Install Riverbed Controller instance and run cloud-init script for:
  - Updating /etc/network/interface file.
  - Inject the ssh key for admin user
- Install Riverbed Analytics instance and run the cloud-init script for:
  - Updating the /etc/network/interface file.
  - Updating the /etc/hosts file.
  - Inject the ssh key for versa user
  - Copy certificates from Riverbed Director and install this certificate into Analytics.

**var.tf file:**

var.tf file will have definition for all the variables defined/used as part of this template. User does not need to update anything in this file.

**terraform.tfvars file:**

terraform.tfvars file is being used to get the variables values from user. User need to update the required fields according to their environment. This file will have below information:

- subscription_id : Provide the Subscription ID information here. This information will be obtained as part of terraform login done above under Pre-requisites step.
- client_id : Provide the Client ID information here. This information will be obtained as part of terraform login done above under Pre-requisites step.
- client_secret : Provide the Client Secret information here. This information will be obtained as part of terraform login done above under Pre-requisites step.
- tenant_id : Provide the Tenant ID information here. This information will be obtained as part of terraform login done above under Pre-requisites step.
- location : Provide the location where user wants to deploy Riverbed HE setup. E.g. westus, centralus etc.
- resource_group : Provide the resource group name where all the resources belonging to Riverbed HE Setup will be created. Default resource group name "Riverbed_HE" will be used.
- ssh_key : Provide the ssh public key information here. This key will be injected into instances which can be used to login into instances later on. Azure does not provide the option to generate the keys. User has to generate the ssh key using "sshkey-gen" or "putty key generator" tool to generate the ssh keys. Here Public key information is required.
- vpc_address_space : Provide the address space information to create the network in azure. By default, 10.234.0.0/16 network will be created.
- newbits_subnet : Provide the subnet information to be cut from the network. By default, /24 subnet will be cut from the network provisioned above. Here, newbits_subnet will have value "8" for this parameter. Since network is in /16 and 8 value here will cut the subnet in /24 (16+8). E.g., If user need to create a subnet of /29 then this newbits_subnet value will be "13" as (16+13=29).
- overlay_network: Provide the SD-WAN overlay network address space. This will be used to install a route on the Analytics to point to the Controller.
- image_director : Provide the Riverbed Director Image ID.
- image_controller : Provide the Riverbed Controller Image ID.
- image_analytics : Provide the Riverbed Analytics Image ID.
- hostname_director : Provide the hostname for Riverbed Director to be used. By default, "rvbd-director" hostname is being used.
- hostname_analytics : Provide the hostname for Riverbed Analytics to be used. By default, "rvbd-analytics" hostname is being used.
- director_vm_size : Provide the instance type/size which will be used to provision the Riverbed Director Instance. By default, Standard_DS3_v2 will be used.
- controller_vm_size : Provide the instance type/size which will be used to provision the Riverbed Controller Instance. By default, Standard_DS3_v2 will be used.
- analytics_vm_size : Provide the instance type/size which will be used to provision the Riverbed Analytics Instance. By default, Standard_DS3_v2 will be used.

**output.tf file:**

output.tf file will have information to provide the output for the parameters (e.g. Management IP, Public IP, CLI command, UI Login for all the instances) after terraform apply operation is succeeded. User does not need to update anything in this file.

**director.sh file:**

director.sh file will have bash script which will be executed as part of cloud-init script on Riverbed Director Instance. Don't update anything in this file.

**controller.sh file:**

controller.sh file will have bash script which will be executed as part of cloud-init script on Riverbed Controller Instance. Don't update anything in this file.

**van.sh file:**

van.sh file will have bash script which will be executed as part of cloud-init script on Riverbed Analytics Instance. Don't update anything in this file.

As part of this terraform template below topology will be brought up:
