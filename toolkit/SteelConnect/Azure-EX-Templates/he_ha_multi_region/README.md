# Overview

This Terraform Template is intended to automate the deployment of a High Availability SteelConnect EX Head End in Azure. It will bring up 2 instances of the SteelConnect EX Director, Controller and Service node Router in two different regions. Additionally, it will create an Analytics cluster with a configurable number of nodes in the primary region and a Log Forwarder Cluster with a configurable number nodes in the secondary region. The topology created by the template is pictured below:

 ![Topology](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gleyfer/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/master/SteelConnect/Azure-EX-Templates/he_ha_multi_region/SteelConnect-EX_HE_HA_Azure.png)

The Router service nodes must be configured to send traffic destined to the overlay subnet via routes learned over BGP from the Controller in the local region and peer Router in the other region. All other communication between instances uses the Azure backbone gateway. The following KB contains additional information this SteelConnect EX Headend topology and steps for configuration of the Analytics cluster and Backup cluster:

**var.tf file:**

var.tf file will have definition for all the variables defined/used as part of this template. User does not need to update anything in this file.

**terraform.tfvars file:**

terraform.tfvars file is being used to get the variables values from user. User need to update the required fields according to their environment. This file will have below information:

- subscription_id : Provide the Subscription ID information here. This information will be obtained as part of terraform login done above under Pre-requisites step.
- client_id : Provide the Client ID information here. This information will be obtained as part of terraform login done above under Pre-requisites step.
- client_secret : Provide the Client Secret information here. This information will be obtained as part of terraform login done above under Pre-requisites step.
- tenant_id : Provide the Tenant ID information here. This information will be obtained as part of terraform login done above under Pre-requisites step.
- location : Provide the regions where user wants to deploy SteelConnect EX HE setup. User need to update both the locations where redundant setup is required. E.g. westus and centralus.
- resource_group : Provide the resource group name prefix where all the resources belonging to SteelConnect EX HE Setup will be created. Default resource group name prefix "SteelConnect-EX-HE" will be used and a resource group will be created for each specified region.
- ssh_key : Provide the ssh public key information here. This key will be injected into instances which can be used to login into instances later on. Azure does not provide the option to generate the keys. User has to generate the ssh key using "sshkey-gen" or "putty key generator" tool to generate the ssh keys. Here Public key information is required.
- vpc_address_space : Provide the address space information to create the network in azure in both regions. By default, 10.54.0.0/16 and 10.55.0.0/16 network will be created in respective region.
- newbits_subnet : Provide the subnet information to be cut from the network. By default, /24 subnet will be cut from the network provisioned above. Here, newbits_subnet will have value "8" for this parameter. Since network is in /16 and 8 value here will cut the subnet in /24 (16+8). E.g., If user need to create a subnet of /29 then this newbits_subnet value will be "13" as (16+13=29).
- overlay_network: Provide the SD-WAN overlay network address space. This will be used for installing routes on the Director and Analytics nodes to point to the controllers. By default, 172.30.0.0/15 will be used.
- image_director : Provide the SteelConnect EX Director Image ID for both the regions.
- image_controller : Provide the SteelConnect EX Controller Image ID for both the regions.
- image_analytics : Provide the SteelConnect EX Analytics Image ID for both the regions.
- hostname_director : Provide the hostname for both SteelConnect EX Director instances to be used. By default, "Director1" and "Director2" hostname is being used for each instance.
- hostname_analytics : Provide the hostname for SteelConnect EX Analytics instances to be created in the primary region. Adding more hostnames dynamically grows the Analytics cluster. By default, a two node cluster consisting of "Analytics" and "Search" hostnames is created. This can be expanded by adding more hostnames in this variable delimited by commas. E.g. hostname_analytics = ["Analytics1","Analytics2","Search1","Search2"] would create a four node cluster in the primary region.
- hostname_forwarders : Provide the hostname for SteelConnect EX Log Forwarder instances to be created in the secondary region. Adding more hostnames dynamically grows the Log forwarder cluster. By default, a two node cluster consisting of "Forwarder1" and "Forwarder2" hostnames is created. This can be expanded by adding more hostnames in this variable delimited by commas. E.g. hostname_forwarders = ["Forwarder1","Forwarder2","Forwarder3","Forwarder4"] would create a four node cluster in the secondary region.
- director_vm_size : Provide the instance type/size which will be used to provision the SteelConnect EX Director Instance. By default, Standard_F8s_v2 will be used.
- controller_vm_size : Provide the instance type/size which will be used to provision the SteelConnect EX Controller Instance. By default, Standard_F8s_v2 will be used.
- router_vm_size : Provide the instance type/size which will be used to provision the SteelConnect EX Router Instance. By default, Standard_F8s_v2 will be used.
- analytics_vm_size : Provide the instance type/size which will be used to provision the SteelConnect EX Analytics Instance. By default, Standard_F8s_v2 will be used.
- forwarder_vm_size : Provide the instance type/size which will be used to provision the SteelConnect EX Log Forwarder Instances. By default, Standard_F8s_v2 will be used.

**output.tf file:**

output.tf file will have information to provide the output for the parameters (e.g. Management IP, Public IP, CLI command, UI Login for all the instances) after terraform apply operation is succeeded. User does not need to update anything in this file.

director-1.sh file will have bash script which will be executed as part of cloud-init script on SteelConnect EX Director-1 Instance. Don't update anything in this file.

**director-2.sh file:**

director-2.sh file will have bash script which will be executed as part of cloud-init script on SteelConnect EX Director-2 Instance. Don't update anything in this file.
