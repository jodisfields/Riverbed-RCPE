On the Jumpbox you can launch PowerShell and connect each NetIM node with ssh using the standard initial **netimadmin** credential.

The default IP Addresses for the nodes are:

- 10.100.5.11 : NetIM Manager node
- 10.100.5.21 : NetIM Worker node
- 10.100.5.31 : NetIM Core node

When the configuration of the nodes is done, stay on the Jumpbox to launch the web-browser and connect to the NetIM webconsole https://10.100.5.31:8543 (https on port 8543 of the core node)
