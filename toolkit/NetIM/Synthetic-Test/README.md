## Overview

This area of the Riverbed Community Toolkit contains Howtos, samples and technical tricks shared by Riverbed and the Community to leverage Synthetic Testing in [Riverbed NetIM](https://www.riverbed.com/products/steelcentral/infrastructure-management.html).

Synthetic Testing often requires dedicated hosts with some special configuration and software preprequisites installed. We like to call them **Robots**. The [robots cookbooks](#robots-cookbooks) section is where you will find how to build some robots.

The section [Synthetic Test Library](#synthetic-test-library)  inventories all the scripts samples and usecases provided in the subfolders.

Any contributions are welcome. More details in the [How to contribute](#how-to-contribute)
