# Metrics Collector Linux ROBOT Cookbook

This robot is a simple configuration that will be able to collect metrics and send them to NetIM using scripts directly from the [GMC-Library](https://github.com/riverbed/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/tree/master/NetIM/GMC-Library) or embedded in a [Synthetic-Test](https://github.com/riverbed/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/tree/master/NetIM/Synthetic-Test). The robot will be connected to NetIM so that you can orchestrate the metrics collection from the NetIM webconsole.

Capabilities summary:

- Linux machine (based on https://ubuntu.com)
- Python3
- SSH from Python script (using http://www.paramiko.org)
- Riverbed NetIM Synthetic Agent

The next paragraph explains how to prepare a Linux Ubuntu machine from scratch. It includes the installation of Riverbed agent.

## Prerequisites

- a fresh Ubuntu machine with root or sudo permissions. Tested with Ubuntu 20.04
- a [Riverbed NetIM](https://www.riverbed.com/products/steelcentral/infrastructure-management.html) instance for Synthetic Test orchestration
- Internet access
- Connectivity between the machine and the NetIM Core node

## Preparation

### Prepare a Robot - Step by step

Connect to the machine, for example via ssh

- Get root access

```bash
sudo su
```

- Install few packages

```bash
apt-get update -y

apt-get install unzip -y

apt-get install python3-pip -y

python3 -m pip install paramiko
```

- Fetch Riverbed NetIM agent installer and prepare the installation

Set the mandatory parameters to your environment in the following script and execute it.

```bash
# mandatory parameters
netim_core_reachable_ip='10.10.10.148'

# optional parameters
netim_core_user=netimadmin
netim_agent_version='3.1.5'
netim_agent_user='netim-agent'
netim_agent_group='netim-agent'

################

# prepare NetIM agent installation
useradd --create-home $netim_agent_user

testengine_path='/data1/riverbed/NetIM/latest/external/TestEngine/'
cd /home/$netim_agent_user
scp $netim_core_user@$netim_core_reachable_ip:$testengine_path/TestEngine-linux*.zip .
unzip TestEngine-linux.zip
chown -R $netim_agent_user:$netim_agent_group /home/$netim_agent_user/Riverbed

# installer
cd Riverbed/TE/$netim_agent_version/
./install.sh
```

At this point the interactive installer will start asking questions. You can just fill the main parameters and skip others.

Main parameters are:
> 1. NetIM host: {{netim_core_reachable_ip}
> 2. user name to which the ownership of the Test Engine files: netim-agent
> 3. group name to which the ownership of the Test Engine files: netim-agent


## Metrics collectors

To collect metrics you can now deploy and use scripts from the GMC or Synthetic-Test libraries available in the [Riverbed Community Toolkit](https://github.com/riverbed/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit).

Next we have to get a local copy of the Riverbed Community Toolkit on the robot, customize and configure a synthetic test in NetIM.

- Fetch a local copy of the Riverbed Community Toolkit

```bash
cd /home/netim-agent

git clone https://github.com/riverbed/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit.git
chown -R netim-agent:netim-agent /home/netim-agent/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit
```

By default the local copy should now be in the folder: **/home/netim-agent/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit**

- Customize a script from the Library

Those scripts can now be customized locally, directly in there subfolders.
By default they will be in folders **/home/netim-agent/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/NetIM/GMC-Library** or  **/home/netim-agent/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/NetIM/Synthetic-Test**

If necessary refer to the README that normally comes with the script  [Riverbed Community Toolkit](https://github.com/riverbed/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/tree/master/NetIM)

- Configure a Synthetic Test in NetIM

In NetIM a Synthetic Test can be defined as below and deployed to run on the agent.

| Parameters | value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | External Script |
| Command | python /home/netim-agent/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/NetIM/GMC-Library/002-NetIM-GMC-Lightweight-Self-Docker-Monitoring/scripts-metrics-api.py |
